# IoT-Based Air Quality Monitoring System

This project implements a compact, low-cost system for real-time monitoring of air quality, temperature, and humidity, utilizing the **ESP8266 NodeMCU** and the **Blynk 2.0 Cloud Platform**.

The system continuously measures air quality by detecting harmful gases such as **NH‚ÇÉ**, **NO‚Çì**, **CO‚ÇÇ**, smoke, and benzene. The collected data is transmitted via Wi-Fi to the cloud platform (Blynk), where it can be visualized on a real-time dashboard and monitored remotely.

## üåü Key Features

* **Real-time Monitoring:** Measures air quality using the **MQ-135 Gas Sensor** (connected to A0) and environmentals (T/H) using the **DHT11 Sensor** (connected to D4).
* **Remote Visualization & Scalability:** Data is transmitted via Wi-Fi to the **Blynk Cloud Dashboard** for visualization and is scalable to multiple nodes.
* **Local & Remote Alerts:** Triggers a local **Buzzer** (D0) and **LED** (D6) alarm when pollutant concentration exceeds a set threshold (e.g., 250 PPM), and generates mobile alerts via Blynk.
* **Compensation Logic:** The firmware reads temperature and humidity from the DHT11 for environmental compensation of gas readings, improving the accuracy of the gas sensor's PPM calculation.

## üíª Interfacing and Logic Summary

The core program runs on the NodeMCU and manages the system's functions:
* Reads the gas sensor's analog value, calculates resistance, and converts it to PPM.
* Controls the buzzer and LED alarm based on PPM exceeding the threshold.
* Sends readings (temperature, humidity, and PPM) to Blynk app virtual pins for real-time display.
* Uses a timer to periodically read sensors every 5 seconds.

### Pin Configuration

| Component | NodeMCU Pin | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MQ-135 Analog Out** | A0 | Analog sensor reading |
| **DHT11 Data** | D4 | Digital data pin |
| **Buzzer** | D0 | Buzzer control (active LOW) |
| **Alarm LED** | D6 | Physical LED indicator |

### Validation and Results

| Parameter | Expected | Observed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Temperature display** | Real-time on Blynk, ¬±2¬∞C accuracy | Accurate (¬±1.5¬∞C) |
| **Air quality reading (PPM)** | Accurate pollution indication (PPM) | Consistent, reliable with valid baseline |
| **Buzzer/LED alarm** | Activates above 250 PPM | Triggers reliably on alarm, silent otherwise |
| **Wi-Fi connectivity** | Stable, auto reconnect | Short disconnects handled, quickly reconnects |
